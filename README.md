React Expense Tracker

This  a project that I did during the course of the Girl Code Bootcamp.
I used React, JS, CSS, HTML and an API.

The app keeps record of exepenses that comes in and goes out. It adds and removes transactions.

USAGE
npm install
# Run on http://localhost:3000
npm start
# Build for prod
npm run build
